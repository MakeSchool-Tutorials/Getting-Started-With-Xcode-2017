This tutorial will guide you through installing Xcode and get you started on your iOS developer journey.

You should be on macOS Sierra (10.12.5) and have Xcode 8.3.3. **DO NOT INSTALL ANY DEVELOPER PREVIEWS OF OS X, iOS, OR Xcode!!!**

Let's get our tools set up.

# Checking macOS

Click the üçé button on the top left of your Mac screen and click `About this Mac`. It should say `macOS Sierra` and `Version 10.12.5`. If it does not say `macOS Sierra`, go [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12) and install Sierra.

If it does not say `Version 10.11.5` but _does_ say `macOS Sierra`, click the üçé button on the top left of your Mac screen and click `App Store`. Install the updates!

# Installing Xcode

Go to the Mac App Store to download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (our integrated development environment or IDE). Make sure you are using the most up to date version from the App Store (not developer preview versions). Drag Xcode onto your dock from your Applications folder so that you can easily access it. **If you already have Xcode installed, make sure that you have the most up to date version!**

# Ready to go!

Once the installations have been completed, you are ready for the first day of Make School! See you soon üòÅ
